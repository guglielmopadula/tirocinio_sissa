This repo contains the file for implementing and testing the VAE.
Description of the files:
- symple-pyro.ipynb is the VAE implementation: learns some stl files and generates an stl file
- compute_OTM is used to generate a tet6 from the learned stl
- calcolume.py computes the volume of the generated tet6
- generateparallelepiped is a random generator of parallelepipeds.

TO DO things:
- Fix the VAE implementation
