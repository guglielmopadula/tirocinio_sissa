# SISSA Internship working directory
This repo contains the data I use for my intership at SISSA.
Description of the files:
- bulbo.stl: original bulb provided by Nicola Demo.
- bulbo*.stl: some deformation of the bulb obtained via FFD
- generate*.py generates deformation (needed for the Deeplearning part)
- other files are straightforward
