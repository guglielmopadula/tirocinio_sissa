This repo contains the file for implementing Semi discrete Optimal transport methods.
Description:
- compute_OTM is used to compute the tet6 of the optimal transport map between two meshes. Requires geogram.
- double_OTM is used to compute the tet6 of the optimal transport map between three meshes. Requires geogram.
- vorpalite contains some useful remeshing algorithms. Requires geogram.
- vorpastat calculate the Hausdorff distances between two meshes. Requires geogram
